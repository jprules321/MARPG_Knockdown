Knockdown system for Multiplayer ARPG by Suri






## NOTE

You will need to put the overrides from <<CustomPlayerCharacterEntity_Knockdown.cs>> for CanAttack and CanDoActions to your own class if you use them anywhere else.

## TODO

- Add a dedicated animation slot for Knockdown. Right now it uses Slot 0 in CustomAnimation array.
- Add Knockdown duration to gameplay rule (Right now is hardcoded to 5 seconds in Knockdown Coroutine
- Add Reduce Knockdown time stat
